## Overview

Understanding the journey of a web request is essential for anyone involved in web development, networking, or IT. This project aims to demystify the complex process that occurs when you interact with a website.

## Request Flow

1. **DNS Request:** We begin with the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution, where "google.com" is translated into an IP address.
2. **TCP/IP:** Learn how the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) establish a connection with the server's IP address.
3. **Firewall:** Understand the role of firewalls in network security and how they ensure secure data transmission.
4. **HTTPS/SSL:** Dive into the importance of HTTPS and how Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption is initiated for secure browsing.
5. **Load Balancer:** Explore load balancers and how they distribute incoming requests among multiple servers for scalability and reliability.
6. **Web Server:** Discover how web servers handle incoming requests, rendering web pages, and serving content.
7. **Application Server:** Learn how application servers generate dynamic web content and interact with databases.
8. **Database:** Explore the role of databases and their interaction with application servers.

## Key Components

- Detailed explanations of each component involved in the web request process.
- Code examples and real-world scenarios.
- Security considerations and best practices for each stage.
