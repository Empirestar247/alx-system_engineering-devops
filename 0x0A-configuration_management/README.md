## Configuration management

## Configuration management is a discipline within software engineering and systems engineering that focuses on establishing and maintaining consistency and control over the configuration of complex systems, including hardware, software, documentation, and other components. It involves tracking and managing changes to these components throughout their lifecycle to ensure the system's integrity, reliability, and consistency.

## Key aspects of configuration management include:

Configuration Identification: This involves identifying and documenting all the components and their attributes within a system. Each component should have a unique identifier, and their relationships and dependencies should be well-defined.

## Change Control: Change control is the process of managing and controlling changes to the system's configuration. It involves evaluating proposed changes, determining their impact on the system, and either approving or rejecting them. Approved changes are then implemented in a controlled manner.

## Configuration Status Accounting: This aspect involves maintaining and updating records of the configuration items, including their current versions, their relationships, and their status. This helps in auditing and reporting on the system's configuration at any given point in time.

## Configuration Verification and Audit: Periodic verification and audit processes ensure that the actual configuration of the system matches the expected or documented configuration. This helps identify discrepancies and ensures that the system remains consistent and compliant with its requirements.

## Configuration Baseline: A configuration baseline is a well-defined, stable version of a system or its components. It serves as a reference point for future changes and is used to ensure that changes do not deviate from the established standards.

## Documentation and Documentation Management: Proper documentation is crucial in configuration management. This includes maintaining detailed records of configurations, changes, and their associated documentation. This documentation helps in understanding and managing the system effectively.

Configuration management is not limited to software alone; it is applied to hardware systems, firmware, and any complex system where maintaining consistency and control over configuration is essential. It is commonly used in industries such as aerospace, defense, automotive, and information technology to ensure the reliability and traceability of complex systems.

## Popular configuration management tools and methodologies include:

Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git and SVN for managing source code.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automating software builds and deployments.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible for managing infrastructure configurations.
Configuration Management Databases (CMDB) for storing and tracking configuration data.
DevOps practices that emphasize automation and collaboration to manage configurations efficiently.

Effective configuration management practices help organizations minimize errors, reduce risks, improve traceability, and streamline the process of making changes to complex systems.

## Configuration Management with Puppet
#
# ## Introduction
 This project focuses on configuration management using Puppet, a powerful tool for automating infrastructure management and ensuring consistent system configurations. Puppet's declarative language allows for modeling configurations instead of scripting, simplifying system administration tasks.
#
# ## Puppet Resource Type: file
# In Puppet, resource types define the desired state of system components. The `file` resource type is used to manage files and directories on target systems.
#
# ## Puppet's Declarative Language
# Puppet uses a declarative language that specifies the desired state of the system, rather than prescribing a series of actions to achieve that state. This approach makes Puppet highly efficient and helps maintain a consistent system state.
#
# ## Puppet lint
# Puppet lint is a tool used to check Puppet manifests for style and syntax errors. It ensures that your Puppet code adheres to best practices and maintains readability.
#
# ## Puppet emacs mode
# Puppet emacs mode is an extension for the Emacs text editor, designed to provide a smoother coding experience when working with Puppet manifests.
#
# ## Requirements
# ### General
# - All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
# - All files should end with a new line.
# - A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
# - Your Puppet manifests must pass puppet-lint version 2.1.1 without any errors.
# - Your Puppet manifests must run without errors.
# - Your Puppet manifests' first line must be a comment explaining what the Puppet manifest is about.
# - Your Puppet manifest files must end with the extension .pp.
#
# ### Note on Versioning
# Your Ubuntu 20.04 VM should have Puppet 5.5 preinstalled.
#
# ## Installation
# ### Install Puppet
# ```bash
# $ apt-get install -y ruby=1:2.7+1 --allow-downgrades
# $ apt-get install -y ruby-augeas
# $ apt-get install -y ruby-shadow
# $ apt-get install -y puppet
# ```
#
# This project is simply a set of tasks to familiarize you with the basic level syntax, which is virtually identical in newer versions of Puppet.
#
# ## Puppet Documentation
# For more details on Puppet and its usage, refer to the [Puppet 5 Docs](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/puppet_index.html).
