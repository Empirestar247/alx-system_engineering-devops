## Web stack debugging #1

## This project focuses on web stack debugging and involves various key concepts, including network basics, DevOps practices, SysAdmin tasks, scripting, and debugging techniques. This README.md file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and how to get started.

## Project Overview

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience in debugging and troubleshooting issues within a web stack. By working on this project, l developed essential skills in identifying and resolving problems that may arise in a web application's infrastructure and codebase.

## TASKS

## Tasks
0. Nginx likes port 80
mandatory
Using your debugging skills, find out what’s keeping your Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the issue. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.

Requirements:

Nginx must be running, and listening on port 80 of all the server’s active IPv4 IPs
Write a Bash script that configures a server to the above requirements

## 1. Make it sweet and short
#advanced
Using what you did for task #0, make your fix short and sweet.

Requirements:

Your Bash script must be 5 lines long or less
There must be a new line at the end of the file
You must respect usual Bash script requirements
You cannot use ;
You cannot use &&
You cannot use wget
You cannot execute your previous answer file (Do not include the name of the previous script in this one)
service (init) must say that nginx is not running ← for real

## Key Concepts
Network Basics: Understanding network fundamentals is crucial for identifying and resolving issues related to connectivity, DNS, routing, and more.

Web Stack Debugging: This project focuses on debugging issues within the web stack, which typically includes components such as web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx), application servers (e.g., Node.js, Ruby on Rails), databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), and load balancers.

DevOps: DevOps practices involve automating processes, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring. These practices are essential for maintaining a stable and efficient web stack.

SysAdmin: SysAdmin tasks involve configuring and maintaining server infrastructure, ensuring system security, and optimizing performance. Understanding these responsibilities is vital for effective web stack debugging.

Scripting: Scripting languages like Bash, Python, or PowerShell are often used for automating tasks and debugging. Proficiency in scripting can expedite issue resolution.

Debugging: Debugging is a core skill for identifying and fixing issues within code, configurations, or infrastructure. Learning different debugging techniques is essential for this project.

## Conclusion
This project is an excellent opportunity to apply and expand your knowledge in network basics, web stack debugging, DevOps, SysAdmin tasks, scripting, and debugging techniques.
