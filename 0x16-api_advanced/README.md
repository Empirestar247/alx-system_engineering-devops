## Background Context
Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.

## This guide provides an overview of advanced API concepts and best practices. You will learn how to read API documentation to find the endpoints you're looking for, handle pagination, parse JSON results, make recursive API calls, and sort a dictionary by value.

## Reading API Documentation

API documentation is essential for understanding how to interact with a service. To find the endpoints you need:

1. **Start with the API's official documentation:** Look for the official documentation of the API you intend to use. It usually provides a comprehensive guide to all available endpoints.

2. **Search for endpoints:** Look for a section that lists available endpoints, often organized by categories such as authentication, data retrieval, and data manipulation. Each endpoint should have a description of its purpose and required parameters.

3. **Check for authentication requirements:** Ensure you understand how to authenticate your requests. This may involve using API keys, tokens, or other authentication methods.

4. **Review example requests:** API documentation typically includes example requests and responses. Studying these examples will help you understand how to structure your requests and interpret the results.

## Using an API with Pagination

Many APIs use pagination to limit the number of results in each response. To handle pagination:

1. **Check for pagination information:** The API documentation should indicate how pagination is managed. Common parameters include `page`, `limit`, `offset`, or `cursor`.

2. **Iterate through pages:** Use a loop to make multiple requests, adjusting the pagination parameters in each request until you have retrieved all the data. Be mindful of rate limits to avoid overloading the API.

3. **Combine results:** Append or merge the results from each page to build a complete dataset.

## Parsing JSON Results

APIs often return data in JSON format. To parse JSON results in your application:

1. **Make a request:** Use a library or tool to make an API request (e.g., `requests` in Python).

2. **Parse the JSON:** Use built-in or third-party JSON parsing functions to convert the API response into a usable data structure in your programming language.

3. **Access data:** Navigate through the JSON structure to access the specific data you need.

```python
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data-endpoint')
data = response.json()  # Parse JSON response
value = data['key']      # Access a specific value
```

## Making Recursive API Calls

Recursive API calls are necessary when an API does not provide all the required data in a single request. To make recursive calls:

1. **Determine the stopping condition:** Decide on the condition that will end the recursion, such as reaching the end of a paginated dataset.

2. **Create a recursive function:** Write a function that makes API requests, processes the data, and calls itself as needed to continue fetching data.

3. **Manage recursion depth:** Use parameters to control the depth of recursion to prevent infinite loops.

```python
def recursive_api_call(page=1):
    response = make_api_request(page)
    data = process_data(response)
    if not is_end_of_data(data):
        recursive_api_call(page + 1)
```

## Sorting a Dictionary by Value

To sort a dictionary by its values in Python:

1. **Use the `sorted` function:** Use the `sorted` function with a custom key function to sort the dictionary items based on their values.

```python
my_dict = {'A': 5, 'B': 2, 'C': 8}
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
print(sorted_dict)
```

This will produce:

```
{'B': 2, 'A': 5, 'C': 8}
```

## Conclusion

This guide has covered essential concepts for working with APIs, including reading documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON data, making recursive calls, and sorting dictionaries by value. Using these techniques, you can effectively interact with a wide range of APIs in your applications.
