## Attack is the best defense
## DevOps

This project embraces DevOps practices by incorporating automation into the development and deployment pipelines. We use continuous integration (CI) tools to automate testing and ensure code quality before deployment. Our CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline streamlines the process of releasing updates and new features, promoting a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams.

## Scripting

Scripting plays a crucial role in our project, enabling automation of repetitive tasks and the efficient management of resources. We utilize scripting languages like Python and Bash to automate routine processes, ensuring consistency and reducing manual intervention. Our scripts simplify deployment, configuration, and maintenance, enhancing the project's overall efficiency.

## Hacking

Ethical hacking is a key component of our project, aimed at strengthening security measures and identifying vulnerabilities. We simulate security scenarios to assess the robustness of our systems and applications. Our ethical hacking tasks, such as network sniffing and dictionary attacks, are designed to highlight potential security weaknesses, allowing us to proactively address them.

## Background Context
Security is a vast topic, and network security is an important part of it. A lot of very sensitive information goes over networks that are used by many people, and some people might have bad intentions. Traffic going through a network can be intercepted by a malicious machine pretending to be another network device. Once the traffic is redirected to the malicious machine, the hacker can keep a copy of it and analyze it for potential interesting information. It is important to note that the traffic must then be forwarded to the actual device it was supposed to go (so that users and the system keep going as if nothing happened).

Any information that is not encrypted and sniffed by an attacker can be seen by the attacker - that could be your email password or credit card information. While today’s network security is much stronger than it used to be, there are still some legacy systems that are using unencrypted communication means. A popular one is telnet.

## Overview

Welcome to the "Attack is the Best Defense" project, an exploration of network security, DevOps, scripting, and ethical hacking. This project, though optional, offers the opportunity to gain extra credit, adding over 100% to your average.

**Note:** Your overall score won't be negatively affected if you choose not to participate. However, if your current average is higher than your score on this project, your average might increase.

Let's delve into the fascinating world of cybersecurity and have some fun!

## Concepts

In this project, we'll delve into the following key concepts:

- Network basics
- Docker

## Tasks

### Task 0: ARP Spoofing and Sniffing

**Advanced**

In Task 0, we'll focus on network security by sniffing unencrypted traffic. While we won't cover ARP spoofing in this task, we will concentrate on sniffing unencrypted traffic and analyzing it.

#### Instructions:

1. Execute the script `user_authenticating_into_server` locally on your Linux machine.

2. Utilize `tcpdump` to sniff the network and extract information.

3. Discover and retrieve the password used during authentication.

4. Paste the discovered password in your answer file.

Please note that this script won't work in a Docker container or on macOS. Use your Ubuntu vagrant machine or another Linux machine for this task.

### Task 1: Dictionary Attack

**Advanced**

Task 1 explores password-based authentication systems and their vulnerability to dictionary attacks. You'll perform a dictionary attack on an SSH account to uncover the password.

#### Instructions:

1. Install Docker on your Ubuntu machine.

2. Pull and run the Docker image `sylvainkalache/264-1` using the provided command.

3. Find or create a password dictionary (you might need multiple dictionaries).

4. Install and use `hydra` to perform a brute force attack on the SSH account named `sylvain` within the Docker container. The container can be accessed via IP `127.0.0.1` and port `2222`.

5. The password you're looking for is 11 characters long.

6. Once you find the password, share it in your answer file.
