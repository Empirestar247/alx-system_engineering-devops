## User Accessing the Website:
A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com. To make this happen, a functioning web infrastructure is required.

## Server: A server is a powerful computer that stores the website's files, processes requests, and delivers web content to users over the internet. In this setup, we have one server performing multiple roles.

## Domain Name (www.foobar.com): The domain name acts as a user-friendly label for the website's IP address (8.8.8.8). It allows users to access the website using a memorable name instead of a numerical IP address.

## DNS Record (www): The DNS record "www" in www.foobar.com is a CNAME record. CNAME stands for Canonical Name, and it's used to associate the www subdomain with the main domain (foobar.com), essentially pointing it to the same IP address (8.8.8.8).

## Web Server (Nginx): The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users. It serves static content directly to users and forwards dynamic requests to the application server. In this setup, Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, managing the distribution of incoming requests.

## Application Server: The application server hosts the website's codebase. It processes dynamic content, such as user logins, form submissions, etc. In this infrastructure, Nginx passes dynamic requests to the application server for processing, and once the processing is complete, the application server sends the response back to Nginx for delivery to the user.

## Application Files (Code Base): The application files (code base) contain the website's logic and data. They are stored on the server and are used by the application server to generate dynamic content based on user requests.

## Database (MySQL): The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, such as user accounts, posts, comments, etc. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update the required data to fulfill user requests.

## Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer through the HTTP protocol. When the user enters www.foobar.com in their browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server (8.8.8.8). The server processes the request, gathers the necessary data, and sends an HTTP response back to the user's browser, which then displays the website content.
